# kami-flow

KAMI Flow — orchestration layer for end-to-end digital implementation.

Restored from the legacy `kami-engine/kami-flow` Rust crate's `src/lib.rs`
(kotoba-lang/kami-engine, deleted in PR #82 "Remove Rust workspace from
kami-engine") as a zero-dependency, portable `.cljc` per ADR-2607010930
(`com-junkawasaki/root`, `90-docs/adr/`).

P10 integrated pipeline:

```
RTL -> PnR -> GDSII -> Verify/Power/DFT/SI/Yield -> STA -> DRC/LVS -> Signoff
```

## Scoping correction

This crate was earlier mistakenly recorded as out of scope / an unrelated
Node.js + Cypher graph-ingest tool. That description genuinely applies to
the sibling `graph/` subdirectory that shares the same `kami-flow/` folder
in `kami-engine` (a `neo4j_bulk_ingest.cypher`-based tool, unrelated to
digital-implementation orchestration) — it does **not** apply to this
crate's own `src/lib.rs`, which had never actually been inspected before
this restoration. Only `src/lib.rs` was ported here; `graph/` remains
correctly out of scope and untouched.

## What it does

`flow/run-minimal-flow` runs a trivial single-module design through the
full pipeline and produces a `SignoffReport`: parse -> place & route ->
export GDSII -> equivalence check -> power/IR-drop estimate -> DFT scan
insertion + ATPG -> signal-integrity (transmission line + eye diagram) ->
Monte Carlo yield + PVT corners -> STA -> DRC/LVS -> pass/fail signoff
checks against configurable `FlowThresholds`. `flow/render-signoff-html`
renders the report as a standalone HTML summary page.

It is a pure-data orchestrator — no GPU, no native FFI, no wasm-bindgen —
that calls into 7 already-restored sibling EDA crates, one dependency per
pipeline stage:

STA and DRC/LVS are computed locally (as in the original Rust — there was
never a dedicated `kami-sta`/`kami-drc` crate).

## Notes on the port

- `pnr.gdsii/export-gdsii` is JVM-only (`java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream`),
  so `flow/run-minimal-flow` (which calls it to produce the GDSII
  artifact) is JVM-only too — the same constraint the original Rust crate
  had transitively via `kami_pnr::gdsii`.
- The original Rust used `serde_json` to hash/serialize `FlowInput` and to
  produce `run_minimal_flow_json`'s output. To keep the crate
  zero-dependency, this port substitutes `pr-str` (EDN) for JSON
  serialization — semantically equivalent (deterministic serialization of
  the same input/report data) but not byte-identical to the Rust JSON
  output.
- `Result<T, FlowError>` is ported as the `[:ok v]` / `[:error msg]`
  2-tuple convention already used elsewhere in this migration (e.g.
  `rtl.hdl/parse-verilog`).
- All names are kebab-cased (`run_minimal_flow` -> `run-minimal-flow`,
  `max_ir_drop_mv` -> `:max-ir-drop-mv`, etc).

## Size / tests

- `src/flow.cljc`: 392 lines.
- `test/flow_test.cljc`: 5 tests / 23 assertions (all 4 original Rust
  `#[test]`s ported 1:1, plus a namespace-loads smoke test) — 0 failures,
  0 errors.
